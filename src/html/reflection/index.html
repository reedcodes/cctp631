      <span>What's the deal with misinformation?</span>
    </h1>

    <p>Over the past few years, there has been much discussion about "fake news" and the spread of "problematically inaccurate information" (Jack 1) online and in the media. The difference in problematic content lies in its intent.</p>

    <div class="full">
      <div class="compare">
        <p><strong>Misinformation</strong> is information that is incorrect or inaccurate but <em>unintentionally</em> so (2).</p>
        <p><strong>Disinformation</strong> is <em>purposeful</em> in its inaccuracy and is often created to deceive or cause confusion (3).</p>
      </div>
    </div>

    <p>However, regardless of intent, dis- or misinformation is problematic because it has the potential to cause physical, emotional, political, and financial harm to individuals, communities, and society.</p>

    <p>As recently as March 2021 (at the time of this writing), heads of major social media and tech companies testified about misinformation, its proliferation on their platforms, and the possible solutions for mitigating its spread (Bond).</p>
