      <span>The claim: Fat (obese) people make up most of the world's COVID-19 deaths.</span>
    </h1>

    <p>On 4 March 2021, the World Obesity Federation released a new report titled <i>COVID-19 and Obesity: The 2021 Atlas</i>. The <abbr>WOF</abbr> used World Obesity Day to publicize their report, with the highlight that nearly 90% of COVID-19 deaths have been in countries with high rates of obesity.</p>

    <blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-theme="dark"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">Obesity is a disease that does not receive prioritisation commensurate with its prevalence and impact, which is now fastest rising in emerging economies.<br><br>We&#39;ve just released our new report &#39;COVID-19 and Obesity: The 2021 Atlas&#39; for <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/WorldObesityDay?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">#WorldObesityDay</a> ⭕<br><br>➡️ <a href="https://t.co/sRaCjG5hA9">https://t.co/sRaCjG5hA9</a> <a href="https://t.co/Q326y6Orfk">pic.twitter.com/Q326y6Orfk</a></p>&mdash; World Obesity (@WorldObesity) <a href="https://twitter.com/WorldObesity/status/1367535565999063045?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">March 4, 2021</a></blockquote>

    <p>Over the next few days, several mainstream news organizations reported on the story, including <i>The Washignton Post</i>, whose headline mimicked the main talking points from the tweets sent from the <abbr>WOF</abbr> marking <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/WorldObesityDay">#WorldObesityDay</a>.</p>

    <blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-theme="dark"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">Most virus deaths occurred in countries where majority of adults are overweight, report finds <a href="https://t.co/PwUTbsAo3t">https://t.co/PwUTbsAo3t</a></p>&mdash; The Washington Post (@washingtonpost) <a href="https://twitter.com/washingtonpost/status/1367780010023587840?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">March 5, 2021</a></blockquote>

    <p>What most people took away from this report and the subsequent articles, and then shared and discussed on Twitter, was that most of the people who have died from COVID-19 have been fat or obese, and that being fat is a leading cause of death by COVID-19.</p>

    <div class="reactions full">

    <p>But what <em>does</em> the <abbr>WOF</abbr> report state? How is "majority overweight" defined? Are most of COVID-19 deaths due to people being fat, overweight, or obese? And what <em>exactly</em> do any of those terms mean?</p>

    <h1>
      <span class="fa-fw fas fa-gavel" aria-hidden="true"></span>
      <span>The verdict: do fat people make up the most numbers of COVID-19 deaths?</span>

    </div>

    <p>Mary Ellen Cagnassola at <i>Newsweek</i> did some digging into the claim, and summarizes key points of the <abbr>WOF</abbr>'s report, noting that the <abbr>WOF</abbr> analyzed data from secondary sources, including Johns Hopkins University and the World Health Organization Global Health Observatory. Cagnassola finds that the analysis identifies a "linear correlation between a nation's COVID mortality and obesity rate", and that it does not specify the percentage of overweight or obese individuals of the overall COVID-19 mortality rate.</p>

    <div class="verdict full">
      <p><strong>False!</strong></p>
      <p>The <abbr>WOF</abbr> report does <em>not</em> state that nearly 90% of COVID-19 deaths were fat individuals, <em>nor</em> does it state that being fat causes COVID-19.</p>
      <p>The report <em>does</em> state that "2.2 million of the global 2.5 million COVID-19 deaths reported in February <em>occurred in countries</em> where more than half the population is classified as overweight" (Cagnassola; emphasis added).</p>
