      <span>The claim: Fat (obese) people make up most of the world's COVID-19 deaths.</span>
    </h1>

            <p>On 4 March 2021, the World Obesity Federation released a new report titled <i>COVID-19 and Obesity: The 2021 Atlas</i>.
                The <abbr>WOF</abbr> used World Obesity Day to publicize their report, with
                the highlight that nearly 90% of COVID-19 deaths have been in countries
                with high rates of obesity.</p>
            <blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-theme="dark">
                <p lang="en" dir="ltr">Obesity is a disease that does not receive prioritisation commensurate

            <p>Over the next few days, several mainstream news organizations reported
                on the story, including
                <p>The Washignton Post</i>, whose headline mimicked the main talking points

                    <p>What most people took away from this report and the subsequent articles,
                        and then shared and discussed on Twitter, was that most of the people who
                        have died from COVID-19 have been fat or obese, and that being fat is a
                        leading cause of death by COVID-19.</p>

                    <p>But what <em>does</em> the <abbr>WOF</abbr> report state? How is "majority
                        overweight" defined? Are most of COVID-19 deaths due to people being fat,
                        overweight, or obese? And what <em>exactly</em> do any of those terms mean?</p>

                    <p>Mary Ellen Cagnassola at <i>Newsweek</i> did some digging into the claim,
                        and summarizes key points of the <abbr>WOF</abbr>'s report, noting that
                        the <abbr>WOF</abbr> analyzed data from secondary sources, including Johns
                        Hopkins University and the World Health Organization Global Health Observatory.
                        Cagnassola finds that the analysis identifies a "linear correlation between
                        a nation's COVID mortality and obesity rate", and that it does not specify
                        the percentage of overweight or obese individuals of the overall COVID-19
                        mortality rate.</p>

                            deaths were fat individuals, <em>nor</em> does it state that being fat causes
                            COVID-19.</p>
                        <p>The report <em>does</em> state that "2.2 million of the global 2.5 million
                            COVID-19 deaths reported in February <em>occurred in countries</em> where
                            more than half the population is classified as overweight" (Cagnassola;
