            <p>On 4 March 2021, the World Obesity Federation released a new report titled <i>COVID-19 and Obesity: The 2021 Atlas</i>.
                The WOF used World Obesity Day to publicize their report, with the highlight
                that nearly 90% of COVID-19 deaths have been in countries with high rates
                of obesity.</p>

                <p>Mary Ellen Cagnassola at <i>Newsweek</i> did some digging into the claim,
                    and summarizes key points of the WOF's report, noting that the WOF analyzed
                    data from secondary sources, including Johns Hopkins University and the
                    World Health Organization Global Health Observatory. Cagnassola finds that
                    the analysis identifies a "linear correlation between a nation's COVID
                    mortality and obesity rate", and that it does not specify the percentage
                    of overweight or obese individuals of the overall COVID-19 mortality rate.</p>

      <span>What information is actually in the report?</span>
    </h1>

                    <p>The WOF's report was released on World Obesity Day, observed on March
                        4, 2021. The report had several key points, including:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>an estimated 2.2 million, out of an estimated 2.5 million, of COVID-19-related
                            deaths worldwide occurred in countries with an overweight population above
                            50% (6),</li>
                        <li>COVID-19 mortality rates were ten times higher in countries with overweight
                            populations above 50% than in countries with overwight populations under
                            50% (20),</li>
                        <li>overweight individuals were hospitalized at higher rates than non-overweight
                            individuals (12), and</li>
                        <li>the estimated cost of COVID-19 over the period 2020 through 2025 could
                            be between $6 and $7 trillion (24).</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>The WOF defines <i>overweight</i> according to a body mass index (BMI) of
                        25 kg/m<sup>2</sup> and above, and <i>obese</i> as 30 kg/m<sup>2</sup> and
                        above (6). The report also contains the facts and numbers for each of the
                        160 countries included for study (34-222).</p>
                    <p>Cagnassola emphasizes that the report does not provide a global percentage
                        of people who were overweight <em>and</em> who also died of COVID-19.</p>
                     <h1>
      <span class="fa-fw fas fa-quote-right" aria-hidden="true"></span>
      <span>Did people misunderstand the report's messaging?</span>
    </h1>

                    <p>Patricia Dickson posted an article on Twitter claiming that the United
                        States has a high COVID-19 mortality rate due to its large obese population.
                        However, the article never states that obesity is a direct cause of COVID-19
                        death rates; it does state that the WOF's report claims "the connection
                        may account" for death rates in the U.S. (Curl). The headline is inaccurate,
                        likely leading readers to believe that fat causes death via COVID-19.</p>
                    <p>
                        <img class="right" src="/cctp631/dist/images/venn.png" alt="A venn diagram showing the overlap of people who died in 2020 who were overweight and people who died of COVID-19. The overlap is not defined in the WOF's report."
                        />Further, in repsonse to a tweet about the pandemic's longevity due to
                        anti-masking efforts, Jack Posobiec argues instead that most COVID-19 deaths
                        were "people who were overweight". Again, as Cagnassola debunked in the <i>Newsweek</i> fact
                        check, this is not accurate! The misunderstanding is most likely due to
                        misreading one of the WOF's key points from their report, that 2.2 million
                        deaths, or about 88% of all COVID-19-related deaths worldwide occured in
                        countries where at least 50% of the population could be classified as "overweight"
                        (World Obesity Federation 6). Cagnassola clarified that the deaths "occurred
                        in countries" with a majority overweight population, which does not necessarily
                        mean that those individual deaths were overweight people themselves.</p>
                    <p>Orla Woodward's tweet argues that if the "root causes of obesity" were
                        addressed well before the pandemic began, hundreds of thousands of deaths
                        could have been avoided, in addition to saving trillions of dollars, and
                        states that information comes from the WOF's report. Yet, the report admits
                        that the costs of COVID-19 due to overweight "cannot be easily assessed,"
                        and contends that most of the ecomonic losses are a result of overburdened
                        healthcare systems and government lockdowns (24). The WOF's $6 to $7 trillion
                        estimate of overall costs in the five-year period from 2020 through 2025
                        is an educated guess based on a secondary source that approximately 29.5%
                        of COVID-19 hospitalizations were overweight individuals. Woodward is partly
                        correct, though, in that the report does assert that hundreds of thousands
                        of deaths might not have occurred if all countries surveyed had overweight
                        populations under 50%.</p>
                    <p>Additionally, both Dickson and Woodward use the term <i>obesity</i> in their
                        tweets, which echoes the vocabulary of many on Twitter discussing the report,
                        and the connection (if any) between weight and COVID-19. Although the report
                        was published by an organization with the word <i>obesity</i> in its name,
                        the report's baseline category is <i>overweight</i>, using a BMI of 25 kg/m<sup>2</sup>; <i>obese</i>,
                        on the other hand, is 30 kg/m<sup>2</sup>. This terminology may have confused
                        readers, especially since the report was released and publicized heavily
                        on World Obesity Day.</p>

                    <p>In an article for <i>Psychology Today</i>, Clark writes that one of the

                        if it is false, the more likely you are to believe it. This is supported
                        by research published by Frederick, et al. who reveal that antifat stigma
                        increases the more a person is exposed to fat-negative information, leading
                        to beliefs that fat poses health risks, that weight is within a person's
                        control, that fat people should be charged more for healthcare and health
                        insurance, among others (543). In addition to the prevalence of antifat
                        articles a person reads, Saguy and Almeling find</p>
                    <blockquote>the news media do dramatize more than the studies on which they are reporting
                        and are more likely than the original science to highlight individual blame

                        writing), and is still very much at the forefront of everyone's mind. With
                        vaccines now rolling out across the U.S., many are anxiously waiting on
                        their eligibility as certain groups have been prioritized in early phases,
                        including "obese" individuals.</p>

      <span>Why did people then further spread the misinformation?</span>
    </h1>

                     <h2>Emotional fodder</h2>

                    <p>Between the misinformation surrounding the WOF's report, and the early
                        phases of the vaccine rollouts, stress, uncertainty, and anger are only
                        a few of the emotions bubbling to the surface for some people, bringing
                        up a lot of fear and speculation. For example:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>obesity caused COVID-19, which in turn triggered financial instability
                            for small-business owners (@FreeThink68);</li>
                        <li>children are burdered with wearing masks because fat people exacerbated
                            the pandemic (@woody20005);</li>
                        <li>fat people being in a priority group for the vaccine is "special treatment"
                            that will lead to other undesirable groups, such as serial killers, moving
                            ahead in the queue (@tbarksdl);</li>
                        <li>people no longer care for their neighbors, and have ignored their "civic
                            duty" by refusing to lose weight (@GeezLiberty); and</li>
                        <li>obesity is the reason that the pandemic even happened at all (@AlexPKeetn).</li>

                    <p>Although Garrett's article examines Facebook, the same theories apply:
                        emotions, especially anger, drive people to continue the spread of misinformation.
                        When that misinformation seems to confirm a person's existing biases, it
                        riles up that anger, prompting a swift share of that post.</p>
