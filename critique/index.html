    </h1>

            <p>On 4 March 2021, the World Obesity Federation released a new report titled <i>COVID-19 and Obesity: The 2021 Atlas</i>.
                The WOF used World Obesity Day to publicize their report, with the highlight
                that nearly 90% of COVID-19 deaths have been in countries with high rates
                of obesity. Over the next few days, several mainstream news organizations
                reported on the story, including <i>The Washington Post</i>, whose headline
                mimicked the main talking points from the tweets sent from the WOF marking

            <p>What most people took away from this report and the subsequent articles,

            <p>But what <em>does</em> the WOF report state? How is "majority overweight"
                defined? Are most of COVID-19 deaths due to people being fat, overweight,
                or obese? And what <em>exactly</em> do any of those terms mean?</p>

            </div>
            <p>Mary Ellen Cagnassola at <i>Newsweek</i> did some digging into the claim,
                and summarizes key points of the WOF's report, noting that the WOF analyzed
                data from secondary sources, including Johns Hopkins University and the
                World Health Organization Global Health Observatory. Cagnassola finds that
                the analysis identifies a "linear correlation between a nation's COVID
                mortality and obesity rate", and that it does not specify the percentage
                of overweight or obese individuals of the overall COVID-19 mortality rate.</p>
            <div
            class="verdict full">
                <p>The WOF report does <em>not</em> state that nearly 90% of COVID-19 deaths

                <p>The report <em>does</em> state that "2.2 million of the global 2.5 million
                    COVID-19 deaths reported in February <strong class="highlight">occurred in countries</strong> where

      <span>What information is actually in the report?</span>
    </h1>

                <p>The WOF's report was released on World Obesity Day, observed on March
                    4, 2021. The report had several key points, including:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>an estimated 2.2 million, out of an estimated 2.5 million, of COVID-19-related
                        deaths worldwide occurred in countries with an overweight population above
                        50% (6),</li>
                    <li>COVID-19 mortality rates were ten times higher in countries with overweight
                        populations above 50% than in countries with overweight populations under
                        50% (20),</li>
                    <li>overweight individuals were hospitalized at higher rates than non-overweight
                        individuals (12), and</li>
                    <li>the estimated cost of COVID-19 over the period 2020 through 2025 could
                        be between $6 and $7 trillion (24).</li>
                </ul>
                <p>The WOF defines <i>overweight</i> according to a body mass index (BMI) of
                    25 kg/m<sup>2</sup> and above, and <i>obese</i> as 30 kg/m<sup>2</sup> and
                    above (6). The report also contains the facts and numbers for each of the
                    160 countries included for study (34-222).</p>
                <p>Cagnassola emphasizes that the report does not provide a global percentage
                    of people who were overweight <em>and</em> who also died of COVID-19.</p>
                 <h1>
      <span class="fa-fw fas fa-quote-right" aria-hidden="true"></span>
      <span>Did people misunderstand the report's messaging?</span>
    </h1>

                <p>Patricia Dickson posted an article on Twitter claiming that the United
                    States has a high COVID-19 mortality rate due to its large obese population.
                    However, the article never states that obesity is a direct cause of COVID-19
                    death rates; it does state that the WOF's report claims "the connection
                    may account" for death rates in the U.S. (Curl). The headline is inaccurate,
                    likely leading readers to believe that fat causes death via COVID-19.</p>
                <p>Further, in response to a tweet about the pandemic's longevity due to
                    anti-masking efforts, Jack Posobiec argues instead that most COVID-19 deaths
                    were "people who were overweight". Again, as Cagnassola debunked in the <i>Newsweek</i> fact
                    check, this is not accurate! The misunderstanding is most likely due to
                    misreading one of the WOF's key points from their report, that 2.2 million
                    deaths, or about 88% of all COVID-19-related deaths worldwide occurred
                    in countries where at least 50% of the population could be classified as
                    "overweight" (World Obesity Federation 6). Cagnassola clarified that the
                    deaths "occurred in countries" with a majority overweight population, which
                    does not necessarily mean that those individual deaths were overweight
                    people themselves.</p>

                    <img src="/cctp631/dist/images/venn.png" alt="A venn diagram showing the overlap of people who died in 2020 who were overweight and people who died of COVID-19."

                        </br/> <i>Figure 1.</i> Of the total number of people who died in 2020, worldwide,
                        there is an overlap between the people who were overweight or obese, and
                        people who died of COVID-19. That overlap is not 88%, and is not defined
                        in the WOF's report.</figcaption>
                </figure>
                <p>Orla Woodward's tweet argues that if the "root causes of obesity" were
                    addressed well before the pandemic began, hundreds of thousands of deaths
                    could have been avoided, in addition to saving trillions of dollars, and
                    states that information comes from the WOF's report. Yet, the report admits
                    that the costs of COVID-19 due to overweight "cannot be easily assessed,"
                    and contends that most of the economic losses are a result of overburdened
                    healthcare systems and government lockdowns (24). The WOF's $6 to $7 trillion
                    estimate of overall costs in the five-year period from 2020 through 2025
                    is an educated guess based on a secondary source that approximately 29.5%
                    of COVID-19 hospitalizations were overweight individuals. Woodward is partly
                    correct, though, in that the report does assert that hundreds of thousands
                    of deaths might not have occurred if all countries surveyed had overweight
                    populations under 50%.</p>
                <p>Additionally, both Dickson and Woodward use the term <i>obesity</i> in their
                    tweets, which echoes the vocabulary of many on Twitter discussing the report,
                    and the connection (if any) between weight and COVID-19. Although the report
                    was published by an organization with the word <i>obesity</i> in its name,
                    the report's baseline category is <i>overweight</i>, using a BMI of 25 kg/m<sup>2</sup>; <i>obese</i>,
                    on the other hand, is 30 kg/m<sup>2</sup>. This terminology may have confused
                    readers, especially since the report was released and publicized heavily
                    on World Obesity Day.</p>
                <div class="full">
                    <p>These tweets seem to demonstrate a misunderstanding of the report on the

      <span class="fa-fw fas fa-edit" aria-hidden="true"></span>
      <span>What was the goal in posting misinformation about the report?</span>
    </h1>

                <p>The WOF originally released the report to highlight the correlation between
                    countries with majority overweight populations and high COVID-19-related
                    mortality rates in order to "avert future crises" (3).</p>
                <p>Based on the phrasing of the tweets quoted above, and of various other
                    tweets discussing this topic, one hypothesis of the users' intentions in
                    posting the misinformation is placing blame. The word <i>blame</i> is specifically
                    used in Dickson's post, to name high rates of obesity as a main cause of
                    widespread outbreaks in the U.S. When French suggests that anti-masking
                    efforts have greatly extended the pandemic, Posobiec instead shifts responsibility
                    onto people who are overweight, not those who refused to wear masks. Lastly,
                    Woodward holds obesity accountability for the monumental numbers of COVID-19
                    death.</p>
                 <h1>
      <span class="fa-fw fas fa-lightbulb" aria-hidden="true"></span>
      <span>Why did people believe the resulting misinformation?</span>
    </h1>

                 <h2>Repeated information</h2>

                <p>The more you hear a piece of information, even if it is false, the more
                    likely you are to believe it (Altay 2; Clark). This is supported by research
                    published by Frederick, et al. who reveal that antifat stigma increases
                    the more a person is exposed to fat-negative information, leading to beliefs
                    that fat poses health risks, that weight is within a person's control,
                    that fat people should be charged more for healthcare and health insurance,
                    among others (543). In addition to the prevalence of antifat articles a
                    person reads, Saguy and Almeling find</p>
                <blockquote>the news media do dramatize more than the studies on which they are reporting
                    and are more likely than the original science to highlight individual blame
                    for weight (53).</blockquote>
                 <h2>Existing biases</h2>

                <p>Everyone knows that being fat is bad, right? This "conventional wisdom"
                    (Harrison) is accepted by everyday people as hard science, when that's
                    not always the case. This antifat stigma, drilled into us by a barrage
                    of news stories and weight loss advertising, results in negative opinions
                    of fat people, inferior healthcare for fat people, misinformation spread
                    about fat people, and sometimes targeted harassment of fat people. "People's

                <p>As Clark puts it in rule number five, "rumors reflect the zeitgeist".
                    COVID-19 has been a global pandemic for over a year (at the time of this
                    writing), and is still very much at the forefront of everyone's mind. With
                    vaccines now rolling out across the U.S., many are anxiously waiting on
                    their eligibility as certain groups have been prioritized in early phases,
                    including "obese" individuals.</p>

      <span>Why did people then further spread the misinformation?</span>
    </h1>

                 <h2>Emotional fodder</h2>

                <p>Between the misinformation surrounding the WOF's report, and the early
                    phases of the vaccine rollouts, stress, uncertainty, and anger are only
                    a few of the emotions bubbling to the surface for some people, bringing
                    up a lot of fear and speculation. For example:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>obesity caused COVID-19, which in turn triggered financial instability
                        for small-business owners (@FreeThink68);</li>
                    <li>children are burdened with wearing masks because fat people exacerbated
                        the pandemic (@woody20005);</li>
                    <li>fat people being in a priority group for the vaccine is "special treatment"
                        that will lead to other undesirable groups, such as serial killers, moving
                        ahead in the queue (@tbarksdl);</li>
                    <li>people no longer care for their neighbors, and have ignored their "civic
                        duty" by refusing to lose weight (@GeezLiberty); and</li>
                    <li>obesity is the reason that the pandemic even happened at all (@AlexPKeetn).</li>

                <p>Although Garrett's article examines Facebook, the same theories apply:
                    emotions, especially anger, drive people to continue the spread of misinformation.
                    When that misinformation seems to confirm a person's existing biases, it
                    riles up that anger, prompting a swift share of that post.</p>
                 <h2>Simplicity</h2>

                <p>Rubin suggests that social media platforms such as Twitter provide an
                    effortless user experience for people to post and repost information, and
                    those platforms are complacent in their approach to misinformation and
                    hate speech (1025-1026). In addition, social influences can gain large
                    followings, contributing financial benefits to those platforms, further
                    disincentivizing their motivation to regulate misinformation spread.</p>
                 <h1>
      <span class="fa-fw fab fa-twitter" aria-hidden="true"></span>
      <span>Conclusion</span>
    </h1>

                <p>Marwick notes three parts of a sociotechnical model of social media spread:</p>
                <ol>
                    <li>people derive meaning from the interactions on social media;</li>
                    <li>media is often designed with an intended purpose for its audience; and</li>
                    <li>the delivery method of the media can affect the inferred meaning.</li>
                </ol>
                <p>Here, users on Twitter read the posts from the WOF regarding its new report,
                    and took away their own (mis)understandings. While the WOF has its own
                    purpose in posting about its report &#8212; publicizing its release &#8212;
                    users had either similar or different agendas in reposting it, depending
                    on their interpretation of the report or the subsequent misinformation.
                    As Twitter is a social media platform that fosters communication and sharing,
                    retweeting that misinformation became as easy as clicking a button.</p>

             <h2>Justification</h2>

            <p>As this analysis discusses misinformation across social media, specifically
                on Twitter, I decided to create a webpage instead of a more traditional
                essay. This allows for basic embedding of tweets and video, with hyperlinks
                to other posts and resources. I considered creating a Twitter thread, then
                using a bot, such as <a href="https://threadreaderapp.com/">Thread Reader</a> to
                aggregate the tweets, but ultimately scratched that idea, as I didn't want
                to open myself up to possible harassment in my mentions.</p>
            <p>Further, while I wanted to use these examples in my analysis, I did not
                want to specifically call out anyone on Twitter. These tweets are used
                to illustrate the ways that (mis)information can spread on social media,
                not to target these individuals personally. Writing this analysis and publishing
                it as a website follows the five tips that Pen America recommends for challenging
                misinformation:</p>
            <ol>
                <li>research the claim to verify that it is indeed misinformation;</li>
                <li>avoid public confrontation, and message privately, if possible;</li>
                <li>consider the beliefs and motivations of the people posting the misinformation;</li>
                <li>remain composed, and diffuse the situation if it escalates; and</li>
                <li>lead by example, and share the resources and tools needed to verify and
                    fact-check.</li>
            </ol>
            <p>Finally, this analysis focuses only on people's misinformation and misunderstanding
                of the WOF's report and the surrounding news articles. While I do mention
                antifat bias, I do not address problematic issues with the report itself.
                Several users who to address some of those issues include, but are not
                limited to, <a href="https://twitter.com/Artists_Ali/status/1368956411716190209">@Artists_Ali</a>,
