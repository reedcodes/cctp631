                    <p>As Hobbs writes, "weight and health are not perfect synonyms." Anyone
                        can be healthy at any size; conversely, sickness and disease know no weight.</p>
                    <p>Health can be measured <em>holistically</em>, meaning it accounts for emotional
                        and mental health as well as physical. The Association for Size Diversity
                        and Health defines health as existing "on a continuum that varies with
                        time and circumstance for each individual"; that is, weight is not an indicator
                        of health, and health does not have a one-size-fits-all approach ("The
                        Health at Every Size® (HAES®) Approach").</p>

                    <p>The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) state that the prevalence
                        of obesity for adults aged 20 and over in the United States is approximately
                        42% (Hale, et al.), and approximately 9% for severe obesity. The CDC's
                        data defines obesity as a BMI of 30 or higher, and severe obesity as 40
                        or higher.</p>
                    <p>Body mass index (BMI) calculates a person's weight (kilograms) divided
                        by their height (meters) squared; although it is often used to place people
                        into easy categories of underweight, normal, overweight, and obese, it
                        measures <em>appearance</em>, not health (Bacon and Severson; Nuttall).</p>
                    <p>Further, it was formulated for statistical analysis of populations of
                        groups by life insurance companies, and was never intended for individual
                        purposes (Bacon and Severson; Hobbs; Nuttall).</p>

                    <p>BMI is a math formula, and does not take into consideration muscle mass,
                        lean mass, or fat mass, let alone a person's health (Nuttall 120). Additionally,
                        Stoll highlights that the definition of <i>overweight</i> and <i>obese</i>,
                        according to BMI, has changed over time (425), while Nuttall notes that
                        in addition to weight increase, the average height of men in the US also
                        increased between 1960 and 2002 (121).</p>
                    <p>In 2013, the American Medical Association formally recognized obesity
                        as a disease; however, it did so after ignoring the recommendation of its
                        own committee specifically put together to research obesity (Bacon and
                        Severson; Brown; Pollack; Stoll 426). The committee voiced convern that
                        labelling obesity "a disease" would cause more prejudice against fat people.</p>

                    <p>Overall, doctors tend to disregard the concerns of their fat patients,
                        and instead prescribe weight loss for anything from a stuffy nose to a
                        broken arm. With fat patients, providers have shorter appointments, harsher
                        words, and less patience (Hebl and Xu; Hobbs).</p>
                    <p>Hebl and Xu find that doctors consider their fat patients "less healthy...
                        less self-disciplined... [and] more annoying" (1250), and would most likely
                        be less compliant in their advice and prescriptions.</p>
                    <p>Due to this, fat patients are less likely to visit their healthcare providers
                        when they are sick or have other health concerns (Bacon and Aphramor 5;
                        Hobbs; Stoll 428).</p>

                    <p>Dieting can lead to a severe focus on weight loss, leading to disordered

                        of dieting and disordered eating are at greater risk to carry those habits
                        into adulthood (Nuemark-Sztainer, et al. 1004).</p>
                    <p>Unhealthy disordered eating behaviors include "skipping meals, vomitting

                    <p>In an interview with Hobbs, Corissa Enneking discusses her disordered

                        stigma is to say that it's all "for your own good" (Hobbs).</p>
                    <p>However, fat people who feel the stress of weight discrimination, stigma,
                        and bullying have risk of increased mortality, and many of the health conditions
                        and diseases often thought as being caused by obesity may actually be caused

                        from systems of oppression that allow fat and weight discrimination in
