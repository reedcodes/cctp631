      <span>What's the deal with misinformation?</span>
    </h1>

            <p>Over the past few years, there has been much discussion about "fake news"
                and the spread of "problematically inaccurate information" (Jack 1) online
                and in the media. The difference in problematic content lies in its intent.</p>
            <div
            class="full">
                <div class="compare">
                    <p><strong>Misinformation</strong> is information that is incorrect or inaccurate
                        but <em>unintentionally</em> so (2).</p>
                    <p><strong>Disinformation</strong> is <em>purposeful</em> in its inaccuracy
                        and is often created to deceive or cause confusion (3).</p>
                </div>
                </div>
                <p>However, regardless of intent, dis- or misinformation is problematic because
                    it has the potential to cause physical, emotional, political, and financial
                    harm to individuals, communities, and society.</p>
                <p>As recently as March 2021 (at the time of this writing), heads of major
                    social media and tech companies testified about misinformation, its proliferation
                    on their platforms, and the possible solutions for mitigating its spread
                    (Bond).</p>
